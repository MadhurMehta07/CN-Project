Computer Networks Course Project (Project Topic: Integrated Communication Application)

Developed a video calling application as a project for Computer Networks, using WebRTC framework to enable real-time communication between browsers without a server in between.
Created two user interfaces for sender and receiver, allowing users to join calls, share screens, and toggle microphone and camera using simple toggle buttons. 
Implemented a sophisticated solution with an end button to quickly end calls, ensuring faster response time for users.
